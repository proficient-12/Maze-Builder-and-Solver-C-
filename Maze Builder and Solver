Project Description: Maze Builder and Solver (C++)
🔹 Overview

The Maze Builder and Solver is a mini-project developed in C++ that demonstrates the use of Stacks and Backtracking Algorithms in solving a maze.
It allows the user to input a custom 5×5 maze, find a valid path from the start point (S) to the end point (E), and display the maze with the correct route marked using *.

The project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and STL (Standard Template Library) components like stack and pair for efficient and clean implementation.

🔹 Objectives

To understand and apply the stack data structure in problem-solving.

To use backtracking for pathfinding in a maze.

To implement OOP concepts such as encapsulation and modular programming.

To build an interactive C++ console application for educational and practical learning.

🔹 Working Principle

The maze is represented as a 5×5 grid:

S → Start point

E → End point

0 → Path (walkable cell)

1 → Wall (blocked cell)

The algorithm:

Starts at S and uses a stack (LIFO) to store coordinates.

Explores in four directions: up, right, down, left.

If a dead end is reached, it backtracks by popping from the stack.

Once E is found, the path is displayed with *.

If no valid route exists, the program displays “No solution found.”

🔹 Key Features

Menu-driven interface (Input, Display, Exit).

Custom maze input (5×5).

Input validation for exactly one S and E.

Stack-based backtracking for efficient maze solving.

Displays solved maze with marked path.

Clean and minimal code design using STL and OOP.

🔹 Example Output
Enter your 5x5 maze (characters: 0, 1, S, E)
Row 1: 11111
Row 2: 1S011
Row 3: 10001
Row 4: 11E11
Row 5: 11111

Path found!

Solved Maze (Path marked with '*'):
1 1 1 1 1
1 S * 1 1
1 * * * 1
1 1 E 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
